  legal_basis:
  - Waste Management Law No. 202 of 2020 establishes the Waste Management Regulatory
    Authority (WMRA) and requires licensing for collection, sorting, transport, treatment,
    recycling, and disposal activities.
  - Open burning is prohibited; sorting at source is encouraged under national strategy
    (WMRA/EEAA).
  - EPR (extended producer responsibility) introduced for certain streams including
    WEEE (e-waste).
  notes:
  - Local governorates may operate differently; always follow municipal instructions
    when provided.
  - Informal sector (Zabbaleen) is significant in Cairo—coordination with licensed
    entities is recommended.
